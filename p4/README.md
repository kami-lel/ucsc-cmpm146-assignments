Depth Limit: To prevent infinite loops, the planner prunes branches that exceed a certain depth in the search tree.

Resource-Based Pruning: The planner avoids producing more resources than necessary by checking if the required amount of an item is already available.

Time Constraint: The planner ensures that the total time required for the plan does not exceed the given time bounds.
